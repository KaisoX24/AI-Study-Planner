        Here is the input:

        - Daily available study hours: {hours_per_day}
        - Subjects and their topics:

        The user has marked these topics as weak and should get more revision:

        Now, do the following:
        1. Prioritize the subjects and topics based on importance and weakness.
        2. Suggest how the total study time should be allocated among subjects.
        3. Recommend a study order (which subject to study on which day).
        4. Recommend daily study blocks with break suggestions.

        Respond in a clear, structured format like this:
